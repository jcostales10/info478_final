    vaccinating. We can deduce that not vaccinating due to personal exemption makes up 
    71.6% (44,104 children) of the total number of children (61,598 children) who didnâ€™t 
    get vaccinated. We see that we should be focusing our efforts in targeting children 
    who have personal exemptions."),

    groups. For example, since recorded in September 2018, there are 535 confirmed
    cases of measles among Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn and Queens alone, a
    disease declared."),
  p("Recent trends have shown that in states where there is a ban on personal exemptions,
    there have been a rise in religious exemptions despite only a few religions that
    are against vaccinations. An example is the state of Vermont. The state banned religious
    exemptions and in the following years, there were 7x more religious exemptions than
    before the ban."),
  p("In May 2019, the Washington State Legislature passed a bill that removes the personal
    and philosophical option to exempt children from the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella)
    vaccine required for school and child care entry. This law does not change religious and
    medical exemption laws. The data used to produce the charts is data from the 2017 school
    year, before the bill was passed. Although there will be a decline in the number of
    personal exemptions, there might be an increase in relgious exemptions."),
  p("Religious exemptions may be an increasingly problematic or outdated exemption category, 
    and researchers and policy makers must work together to determine how best to balance a 
    respect for religious liberty with the need to protect public health.")
