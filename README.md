## Project Description: Vaccines
### Purpose:
The purpose of our research project is to explore and gain insight about the prevalence and/or lack of vaccinations in certain populations and regions within, or outside of, the United States. By knowing the presence or lack of vaccination rates within regions and populations one could be able to determine the need for more policy or interventions to enforce vaccinations for the well being of the public.

### Research in the Area:
- [Immunization in the United States: Recommendations, Barriers, and Measures to Improve Compliance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4927017/):

- [Surveillance of Vaccination Coverage among Adult Populations — United States, 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/ss/ss6501a1.htm): This study is an investigation and review of the annual cross-sectional study done by the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) compiling vaccination data from U.S. households. Coverage for all vaccines for adults remained low but modest gains occurred in vaccination coverage for influenza , pneumococcal , Tdap , herpes zoster , and hepatitis B; coverage for other vaccines and groups with vaccination indications did not improve. Racial/ethnic disparities persisted for routinely recommended adult vaccines with white populations covered the most.

- [Nonmedical Exemptions From School Immunization Requirements: A Systematic Review](https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/pmc/articles/PMC4202987/): This study provides a summary regarding the prevalence and trends of nonmedical exemptions (NME) from school vaccination mandates and what it’s meant for the incidences of vaccine preventable diseases. Results showed that NME are increasing and can often be impacted due to their sociodemographic surroundings (ex. Exemption rates are higher in areas with larger proportions of whites and have a college education) Parents also were more likely to opt for a NME when they didn’t feel as if they had enough information about immunization. Parents who were also non-trusting of the government were more likely to file a NME. The exemption rates per state seem to be correlated with how easy it is to obtain NMEs. In regards to incidence rates of vaccine preventable disease, in clusters where there are many parents who opt/file for NMEs, there is a greater outbreak risk and higher incidence rate of diseases that can be prevented with a vaccine. High rates of NMEs can also put those who have gotten vaccines at risk. Discuss prevention strategies and interventions to help address NMEs.

- [A mid-term assessment of progress towards the immunization coverage goal of the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS)](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-11-806): This is a straight-forward assessment of progress made towards a global immunization coverage goal via the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS). There has been progress made, but some countries have made little to no progress at all. This should be addressed as an average global vaccine coverage can prevent future epi/pandemics.

### Datasets:
- [WA State K-12 Immunization Data 2014-2015](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/immunization-data-for-all-students-kindergarten-through-12th-grade-2014-2015-school-year)
- [WA State K-12 Immunization Data 2015-2016](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/all-students-kindergarten-through-12th-grade-immunization-data-by-school-2015-2016)
- [WA State K-12 Immunization Data 2016-2017](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/all-students-kindergarten-through-12th-grade-immunization-data-by-school-2016-2017)
- [Other Immunization Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?tags=immunization&page=1)
- [Global Immunization Data](https://data.unicef.org/resources/dataset/immunization/)

### Target Audience:
- Policymakers
- Parents
- Anti Vaxxer
- The Immunocompromised
- General Public

**What  our audience learn from our resource?**
We hope that when our audience views our resource, they can easily digest and understand areas where there are higher or lower vaccination rates and what that may mean to those living there. By providing visuals and analysis, we hope to educate policymakers, parents, anti-vaxxers, and the general public on the effects of vaccination/no vaccinations and to also provide a call to action to areas that may be experiencing higher than normal rates of infection from disease that may have been preventable by vaccine.

**What are specific questions we can ask?**
- Which areas have higher/lower vaccination rates
- Which areas have more rigid/less rigid policies concerning vaccinations?
- What places have certain exemptions?
- Are there certain outbreak patterns in areas with lower vaccination rates?
- Why might certain areas have the vaccination patterns they have? (outside research)

# Technical Logistics

**Format of Final Product:** Right now we’re leaning towards a Shiny app, but we’re also still considering our other options.

**Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?**
- The data may not be ‘clean’ enough to use off the bat so we may have to figure out the best way to clean it that allows us to use the data

**What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?**

**What major challenges do you anticipate?**
- Coordinating pushes/pulls to minimize overlapping and/or errors when committing
- Coordinating free time to talk about the project as we all have different schedules
